        <h2>Root... The origin</h2>
        <b><i>It all began a dark night...</i></b>
        Just kidding, root is the word for user id 0, in typically UNIX (However Android is not on UNIX) systems, users are identified via user id.<br>
        This user id is unique to each user, Android being built with Linux Kernel (Which is based of UNIX (kind of)) is no exception to this general rule.<br>
        <br>
        <b>So what makes user 0 special?</b>
        <br>The answer lies in the capability of this user. User 0 is refered to as SuperUser (or) Root. <br>
        <button onclick="hideshow('funfactA')">Fun Fact (click me)</button> <p style="display: none;" id="funfactA">su command doesn't stand for Superuser but for Switch User.</p><br>
        The root user can do almost anything, from creating a new user to deleting an existing one, From accessing anything on system to removing the whole system itself.<br>
        This user is like a god to the system, once this user prompts anything THE SYSTEM WILL DO IT. NO. EXCEPTIONS.<br>
        Since he is soo strong, the mobile devices usually suggest against accessing this user. <a href="https://csral.github.io/AndroidSU/against-root">Read Why here.</a>

        <h3>Rooting, what and why?</h3>
        This questions was answered earlier.. Kind of. Root user is inaccessible in Android by default and Rooting is a process of modifiying the system so as to give us access to this particular user.<br>
        To answer why is rather easy than how which will be answered next.
