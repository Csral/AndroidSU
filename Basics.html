    <h1>Welcome, Let's get into basics</h1>
    <b>This pages will teach you the basics of rooting. This is skip-able part.</b>

        <h2>Root... The origin</h2>
        <b><i>It all began a dark night...</i></b>
        Just kidding, root is the word for user id 0, in typically UNIX (However Android is not on UNIX) systems, users are identified via user id.<br>
        This user id is unique to each user, Android being built with Linux Kernel (Which is based of UNIX (kind of)) is no exception to this general rule.<br>
        <br>
        <b>So what makes user 0 special?</b>
        <br>The answer lies in the capability of this user. User 0 is refered to as SuperUser (or) Root. <br>
        <button onclick="hideshow('funfactA')">Fun Fact (click me)</button> <p style="display: none;" id="funfactA">su command doesn't stand for Superuser but for Switch User.</p><br>
        The root user can do almost anything, from creating a new user to deleting an existing one, From accessing anything on system to removing the whole system itself.<br>
        This user is like a god to the system, once this user prompts anything THE SYSTEM WILL DO IT. NO. EXCEPTIONS.<br>
        Since he is soo strong, the mobile devices usually suggest against accessing this user. <a href="https://csral.github.io/AndroidSU/against-root">Read Why here.</a>
        <br><hr>
        <h3>Rooting, what and why?</h3>
        This questions was answered earlier.. Kind of. Root user is inaccessible in Android by default and Rooting is a process of modifiying the system so as to give us access to this particular user.<br>
        To answer why is rather easy than how which will be answered later on.

      <p class="oneclickroot" style="display: none;">
        Well, let's see. These one click rooting apps are indeed famous (or) rather were they?<br>
        The problem arose when the people figured out that these one click rooting apps desite giving root access in most easy way, They also take too much in return.<br>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
          <li>These apps were found to install <a href="http://csral.github.io/AndrodSU/spyware">spyware</a> which can be used to spy on you.</li>
          <li>Being the apps that root, they by default have root access, so these <a href="http://csral.github.io/AndrodSU/spyware">spyware</a> installed cannot be removed easily.</li>
          <li>They are no longer supported for Android version >= 5, Majorly Because of <a href="http://csral.github.io/AndroidSU/selinux">SeLinux Polices</a></li>
          <li>These apps abuse the Android Flaws (The security loopholes)</li>
          <li>Simply binding method of linux is better. (Explained later.)</li>
